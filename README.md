# nyctophilia-repo
Nyctophilia - a 2D deep-sea diving/exploration game.

Made in 2 days (originally) for the Itch.io Mini Jam 103.
Theme: Darkness.
Limitation: You are your own enemy.

After the game jam, I decided to keep working on the game. This repo is the result of that.

I am making the game in Godot. I have used GDScript for the entire game jam, and the code isn't particularly tidy either. Many systems may migrate to C# in the future for maintainability sake but this isn't a concern for now. I will continue to use GDScript for the majority of the project until I feel that it is too slow or messy.
